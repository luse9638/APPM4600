Hello! I'm not quite sure what this repository is. Is this the actual repository that I'm going to be uploading to or is this just a test repository so that we can learn how to use git, and we'll end up making the actual repository some other time? It's truly a mystery.

In terms of directory structure, there's two folders, Homeworks and Labs, which, you guessed it, contain the homeworks and the labs for this class. Each lab and homework has its own dedicated folder containing the instructions for each lab and homework as well as any necessary .py files needed to complete that specific lab or homework.
